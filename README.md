My personal R Programming Scripts
-dice.R is a script with  a pair of virtual dice that you can use to generate random numbers.
the roll() function has two objects...the die object which determines the numbers one can get when the die is rolled. The dice object uses the sample() function to simulate the roll of two die.
The function returns two numbers that can be obtained when the two dice are rolled.
